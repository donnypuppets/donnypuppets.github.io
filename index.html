      <p>Nestled in the temperate rainforests of Olympia, WA, String and Shadow is a company of artists creating giant puppet shows, masks and costumes, shadow plays, (more petite) traveling puppet shows, and – occassionally – short films.</p>  
      <p>As storytellers, String and Shadow blur the line between children's stories and stories for adults, creating heartfelt performances for people of all ages. A mix of magical realism, science fiction, and folk tale, their stories take audiences to the surface of moon, into the belly of a giant fish, and to the headquarters of a sinister intergalactic corporation specializing in the production of "worlds." We are currently planning for summer 2021, more information coming soon!</p>
      <p>Since the onset of Covid-19, S&S has been finding inventive ways to bring live theater to their community in a safe manner. In the spring, they spent two months touring a socially-distanced puppet show through the neighborhoods of Olympia, serenading folks in lockdown. Over the summer they produced possibly the world's first drive-in puppet show, a full-length pageant of giant puppets and masks, with music and narration broadcast on the radio by a low-frequency FM transmitter so audience members could enjoy the show from the safety of their vehicles. </p>
      <blockquote>"Truly beautiful. Every tired activist heart should try to check out this beautiful production. It’s a collective experience, which feels so rare these days, and it’s safe to social distance in your car!"<br>-Emily McArthur, audience review</blockquote>
      <p>String and Shadow is committed to bringing high-quality, accessible live theater to their communities. All of their shows are by suggested donation, with no one turned away for lack of funds. Community involvement is essential to what they do, contributing to and informing the work itself. They believe that in this technological time, live theater is a necessary and life-giving practice, providing an opportunity for community members to come together in the public square and engage with each other through story and art. </p>
